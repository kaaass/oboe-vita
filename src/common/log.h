/**
 * \file
 *
 * Support routines to send messages to the Android log buffer,
 * which can later be accessed through the `logcat` utility.
 *
 * Each log message must have
 *   - a priority
 *   - a log tag
 *   - some text
 *
 * The tag normally corresponds to the component that emits the log message,
 * and should be reasonably small.
 *
 * Log message text may be truncated to less than an implementation-specific
 * limit (1023 bytes).
 *
 * Note that a newline character ("\n") will be appended automatically to your
 * log message, if not already there. It is not possible to send several
 * messages and have them appear on a single line in logcat.
 *
 * Please use logging in moderation:
 *
 *  - Sending log messages eats CPU and slow down your application and the
 *    system.
 *
 *  - The circular log buffer is pretty small, so sending many messages
 *    will hide other important log messages.
 *
 *  - In release builds, only send log messages to account for exceptional
 *    conditions.
